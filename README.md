- 🌱 I’m currently learning qml + python (pyside2 libraries). and the python-binance libs + trading indicators on python to autotrade + plotting data with matplotpy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't have my eyes set on anything rightnow but I might lean towards some trading bots in the future
