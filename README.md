- 👋 Hi, I’m @brtkev
- 👀 I’m interested in python, js/react/react-native, trading, machine learning, automating stuff, and sometimes desktop apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  -  desktop apps with python + qml (pyside2 libraries)... finished this, was fun to learn and make a videoplayer
  -  trading, trading structures and pattern recognition.
  -  mobile dev with react-native
  -  API deployment... did this wasn't hard at all lol, did a pretty basic API tho.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... reserve (@holareserve on twitter), it'll be good to collaborate with them,  I like their project and the fact they are helping people on my country, also I like trading and money so it's kinda on the same page.
- 📫 How to reach me @letalidad on telegram, and @brtkev on twitter
